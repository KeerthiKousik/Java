
class: collection of variables and methods.

note:
every method ends with () 
------------------------------
println()-> output
main()-> execution starts from main
Methods:
---------
->A set of instructions written to perform a particular task.
->Every method will be doing only one task


Every method has two properties:
1)return type 
2)parameter

return_type method_name(par1,...,parN)[

}
ex:
int sum(){
int a=10,b=20,c;
c=a+b;
return c;
}

void sum(){
int a=10,b=20,c;
c=a+b;
System.out.println("sum="+c);
}

Based on the two properties the methods are classified into four types.
1)without return type and without parameters.
ex:void menu();
2)without return type and with parameters.
ex:takeOrder(String order);
3)with return type and without parameters.
ex:String serveFood();
4)with return type and with parameters.
ex:String payBill(int amount)
note: 
with parameters-> the input in main block and 
transfered to sub block(n number of values).

with return type-> the output is in main block i.e from sub block output is transfered to main block.

without parameters-> the input in sub block.

without return type-> the output in main block.
