Types of variables
-------------------------
Types of variables:
1)primitive variable (int age=27)
2)non primitive variable (Person rahul=new Person())
the primitive variables based on declaration is classified into 3 types
1)instance variables
2)static variable
3)local variable
instance variable
----------------------
1) instance variable is decalred inside the class and outsidet the method.
2)one location is generated for one object i.e instance depends upon object.
3)For instance variables memory is allocated in heap area.
4)If we are not intializing the instance variable then jvm will intialise defualt values
ex:
int ->0
String ->null
boolean ->false

static :
--------
class student
{
int id;
float per;
static String colg;
}
note: for id and per the value will be varying from object to object were as for colg it will be same for all objects
for that reason we are declaring the colg variable as static.
1) A variable whose value doesn't change from object to object, is decalred as static
2)A static variable is decalred inside the class and outside the method.
3)Only one copy is generated for static variables.
4)Static depends on class name and memory is allocated in method area.
5)If we are not intializing the static variable then jvm will intialise defualt values
ex:
int -> 0
String ->null
boolean ->false


Local variable
-----------------
1)A variable declared inside a method or block or constructor.
2)For local variables memory is allocated in stack.
3)The scope is when the method is executed.
4)If we are not intialising then compiler will give error.
